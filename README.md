## Description

The model is based on Graph Attention Model to get output predictions for an Ontology based data task (classification/regression). It is also designed to detect important sub-graphs/communities within the ontology graph which are important for the model's predictions.

## Dataset

The code works with two data sources - the Titanic data for suvival prediction, and the TCGA gene expression data for cancer classification

TCGA dataset can be downloaded from [GDC portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). 

## Usage

To work with the above two datasets, the user needs to structure the data files in the data directory as:


Example on TCGA dataset:
<!--
There exists 3 functions (flag *processing*): one is dedicated to the training of the model (*train*), another one to the evaluation of the model on the test set (*evaluate*), and the last one to the prediction of the outcomes of the samples from the test set (*predict*).
-->

### Train

<!-- On the microarray dataset:
```bash
python3 scripts/GraphGONet.py --save --n_inputs=36834 --n_nodes=10663 --n_nodes_annotated=8249 --n_classes=1 --selection_op="top" --selection_ratio=0.001 --n_epochs=50 --es --patience=5 --class_weight 
```
-->

```bash
python3 main.py --dataset data/TCGA --n_communities 3 --epochs 100
```

<!--
### 2) Evaluate

### 3) Predict

The outcomes are saved into a numpy array.
-->


### Train the model with a small number of training samples

```bash
python3 main.py --dataset data/TCGA --n_communities 3 --epochs 100 --n_samples 1000
```

###  notebooks

Please see the notebook entitled *ontologyGNN.ipynb* (located in the notebooks directory) to run the model in a jupyter notebook.
